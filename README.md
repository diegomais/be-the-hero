## :bookmark: Layout

You can view the project layout at this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/sezxxZg03XrIaZvYcfPVPd/Be-The-Hero). Remembering that you will need to have a [Figma](https://www.figma.com) account.

## :seat: Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Setting up the development environment

You will need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before following the instructions below.

### Installation using Docker Compose

The following steps need to be performed inside a terminal window (Windows user may prefer to use the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/windowsterminal) but the Command Prompt will also work).

Clone the repository and build Docker images:

```
git clone https://github.com/diegomais/be-the-hero.git
cd be-the-hero
docker-compose build
```

### Running the services

Use the following command to run all Be The Hero containers (from within the be-the-hero directory):

```
docker-compose up
```

You can now use the API at [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) and view the Web App in the browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Mobile

With an Android phone, you can load this project immediately at [https://expo.io/@diegomais/be-the-hero](https://expo.io/@diegomais/be-the-hero).

#### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or Yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- **npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general. [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

#### Setting up the development environment

Follow the instructions for Expo CLI available in the official [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/).

#### Adding environment variables

1. Rename the file `environment.example.js` on `mobile` directory to `environment.js`.
2. Add the API URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3333`) into `environment.js` file.

#### Installing dependencies and running the mobile application

Run the instructions bellow inside `mobile` directory:

1. `npm install`
2. `expo start`

or

1. `yarn install`
2. `expo start`
